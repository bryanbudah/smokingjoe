    <h1>The All blacks: The greatest sports team in ever</h1>
    <h2>By Smokin’ Joe Kariuki</h2>
     Manchester City beating Manchester United 3-1 a few years ago  and seemingly looking comfortable and not even straining while doing it. It boggles the mind what they can achieve this season.
     They even look much stronger than last season where they were the first team in premier league history to reach 100 points out of a possible 114 and they were also the first team in history to score over 100 goals (they scored 106 goals).
    There closest rival, Manchester united was 19 points adrift.In the 2018/2019 they have garnered 32 points out of a possible 33(we are 12 games into the season)
    <p>It is absolutely frightening what thhe 2018/2019 city team could also achieve and this does not bode well for other teams in the league and are they creating a dynasty?
    This has brought about a conversation as to which is the greatest sports team in history. Is it Real Madrid who has won 13 champion league titles? While the closest rival has 6(Ac Milan).
    And six of the titles were won between 1955 to 1960 by the way while having a game winning percentage of 59.4 % since its inception in 1902.</p>
    Or the Boston Celtics, which has won 17 NBA championships in its illustrious history (there are about 84 teams in the national basketball league).Or the 1980s Los Angeles Lakers who tore the NBA in that decade.
    Or better yet the 1990s Chicago Bulls who won six championships in seven years. The 2015/2016 Golden Warriors also come into mind where they won 73 games out of 84 on their way to their second championship even  breaking the 1996 record of 70 games held by the 1996 Chicago Bulls.
    Though the aforementioned statistics are impressive. The team that stands out among all other sports teams is New Zealand’s Rugby Team affectionately known as the all blacks.
    They have a 77.09% winning record since their inceptions in 1903.They have a winning record with all the teams they have played with since 1903.
    They have lost only to six teams in all the teams they have played with in their 100 year plus history.
    Get this in the last four years they have had a winning record of 93.06%.Mindboggling I know. They have held the number one world ranking longer than all other teams combined.<br>

    They have won the Rugby world cup thrice, more than any other nation. Including winning back to back World Cup titles in 2011 and 2015.They have been named world rugby team of the year ten times in the last seventeen years since the award was introduced.
    An All Black (a player on the New Zealand Rugby Team) has won the World Rugby player of the Year ten times since the award was introduced in 2001.
    Fifteen all blacks have been inducted to the International Rugby Hall of Fame.
    Against the British & Irish Lions, which is a combination of the home nations (England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland) they have won 30 of the 41 matches they have met in.
    They have also won the Rugby Championship which is a competition that includes New Zealand, South Africa, Australia and Argentina sixteen times out of the twenty four times they have competed in.
    This is not just dominance this is transcendence, almost biblical statistics. It even makes it more remarkable that a nation of five million can achieve what they have achieved.
    The above statistics make the All blacks hands down the greatest sports team in history and probably ever.
