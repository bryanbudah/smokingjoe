    <h1>The Infertility curse</h1>
<h2>By Bryan<i>“Smoking Joe” Kariuki<i></h2>
<p>“Why aren’t you pregnant what is wrong with you are you cursed “That is what Jacqueline Mukami (real name withheld) was asked by her mother-in law recently.
“I cry a lot alone no one comforts you everybody isolates you including your husband”. she says amid sobs while holding her handkerchief.
“If you are not going to do what comes naturally I will marry another wife and kick you out”. Her husband always retorts every evening when he comes home drunk.
He has even stopped taking my food and sleeps in the guest bedroom. Sometimes I feel like committing suicide”. She sobs. Each year is her annus horribilis just because she can’t conceive</p>

<p>Jane Nafula (real name withheld) is another one longing for the “fruit of the womb”. 
“When you are single they ask you when you are getting married and when you get married the next question is when you are getting a baby. We have tried”. She says (they have been married for 7 years).”
“Every year we say this is our year but to no avail. Maybe God is testing our faith and resolve in him bless us with quatriplets”.She says while smiling wirily.
 She is lucky as her husband is very supportive of her condition. But the societal pressure is just too much. So much so that she has avoided many social engagements, parties and family gatherings because of the endless barrage of questions regarding her pregnancy and sometimes being hurled abuse and mocked by her own family and other kin.
“When are you adding a family member?”
“Utaname mama-in-law when?”
“Why don’t you want to get pregnant by this man don’t you love him?”
“Umechelewa sana kuitwa mum.Ona marafiki zako wameolewa na wakona watoto shule.unangoja?”
Recently her youngest sister just got married last year and is expecting twins. She has also given social media a wide berth and has become a social pariah.
“Every time I meet people and they ask me such questions not knowing that we have had eight miscarriages for the last six years. I feel like a steak is driving through my heart “she says painfully. 
“My husband is a good man but I can see he is also suffering and is being pressured to add another wife by his family”. She laments decision that he is yet to make.”But it’s getting to him”. She says.
Men have not been left behind. David Lessit (real name withheld) has also has a hidden confession.”I don’t think I can make a woman pregnant”. I have been in a come we stay relationship for three years and my girlfriend (who has a kid from a previous relationship) hasn’t gotten pregnant” (she is not on the pill).he says amid taking shots of vodka.
“We have been having unprotected sex for the last two years once every three days. But still no kid. Having a male heir let alone a child is a big thing in my community. You are respected and you can walk and talk among elders. But what do I tell people back at home”. He says desperately.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia infertility the inability to become pregnant/impregnate after 12 months of regular unprotected sex or carry a pregnancy to term.
 According also to population statistics 1 out of every five couples in Kenya struggle with infertility and 4.2 million Kenyans also need help to conceive or impregnate.
According to Dr. Alfred Murage, a reproductive medicine consultant at Aga Khan University Hospital’s obstetrics and gynecology department, who has worked with couples who have had trouble conceiving naturally for ten years attributes that 30% of the time its due to women factors, 30% of the time is due to men factors and the remaining due to combination of the both male and female or unexplained factors.
The most common cause of infertility in Kenya is blocked tubes. These can be caused by pelvic inflammatory diseases, which arise from unprotected sex with multiple partners and delays in treating sexually transmitted diseases. Irregular menses and ovulation cycles, previous abortions gone wrong thus affecting the uterus and tubes.
Other causes in women include Fibroids Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Lack of ovulation, Pelvic tuberculosis and Cancer treatments
Sperms in many men worldwide has dropped by 50% since 1940.Some of the main causes are Low sperm count Heavy alcohol consumption drinking Heavy smoking, eating junk food, living a sedentary lifestyle without exercise Blocked tubes Men producing antibodies against their own spermA male with sex chromosomes of a genetic female that is XX instead of XYHaving an extra X chromosome.
However there are some cases that when a man reduces the alcohol intake, cuts smoking, improves his diet and exercises regularly they increase their sperm count and virility.
 There are various methods available in combating infertility. And according to baby center.com they include
Use of fertility drugs such as Clomiphene Citrate, which are used to regulate your hormones and trigger ovulation to increase ones’ chances of conceiving.
Surgery can also help fix genetic defects, open blocked fallopian tubes, remove fibroids, 
In vitro fertilization (IVF) eggs are removed from your ovaries and then combined in a laboratory with sperm from your partner or a donor. If fertilization is successful, the resulting embryo or embryos are transferred to your uterus.
Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).This helps overcome male fertility problems or to help the fertilization process along when it might be a challenge. During ICSI, a single sperm is injected into a single egg and the resulting embryo is transferred to your uterus.
Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) eggs are mixed with sperm in a lab. Laparoscopic surgery is then used to inject the mixture into the fallopian tubes so fertilization can occur naturally inside your body. 
Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT) Like GIFT. It involves your eggs and sperm being mixed together in a lab. But during ZIFT, your doctor makes sure the eggs are fertilized and become one-celled embryos called zygotes before using laparoscopic surgery to place them in your fallopian tubes.
Donor eggs and embryos. Using IVF techniques, an egg donated by another woman is mixed with your partner's sperm and transferred to your uterus. If you use a donor embryo, you take medications to prepare your uterine lining for pregnancy before the embryo or embryos are transferred to your uterus.
In Kenya the options available are fertility drugs and The IVF treatment. They are various centers available in Kenya and they are giving hope to childless couples. Costs range anyway between 500,000 shs to 1,000,000shs which is out of reach for most Kenyan couples.
However there is legislation in the works to have the cost being be insured by insurance companies and being inclusive in the NHIF card.
